## Description of the Magma and Approximat Bayes Factor Aggregation Statistics

# Magma p-values
- The magma p-values provided are calculated using the 
[Magma software](https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma).
- The inputs provided are the meta analyzed [genetic association data](https://hugeamp.org/datasets.html) combined by phenotype. 
- Magma algorithm is described in the paper PMID:25885710 [MAGMA: Generalized gene-set analysis of GWAS data.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004219)

# Probabilities 
- The probabilities are calculated from the p-values above by the method described in 
the paper PMID: 35421386 [Evaluating human genetic support for hypothesized metabolic disease genes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35421386/) using a gene prior of 0.05.
